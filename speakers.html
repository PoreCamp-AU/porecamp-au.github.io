<h3 id="jq_bio">Biography</h3>

After undergraduate study Joshua worked for Illumina Technologies as intergration scientist. Before </br>
commencing his his PhD at the University of Birmingham, UK. </br>
Joshua is a founder of PoreCamp along with his supervisor Nick Loman. </br>
Throughout his PhD, Joshua has been able to show many successful </br>
applications of real-time nanopore sequencing as demonstrated in the publications below. </br>

<h3 id="de_ab">Abstract</h3>

<i> After the stampede of sequenced reads, when the QC dust has settled and the mapping has been done, </br>
    it's time to explore the jungle of data provided by the MinION. You will be guided through the process of </br>
    pulling out signal from the noise, using MinION reads for variant detection and error correction, and shown </br>
    how these discoveries can be presented in a way that is easy to understand.</i> </br>

<h3 id="de_bio">Biography</h3>

Descibed as a "computer whisperer" by <a href="http://www.malaghan.org.nz/news/bioinformatics/"> TedX </a>,
David is a freelance bioinformatics research analyist based at the Malaghan Institute. </br>
David collaborates with many additional international clients including The Max Planck Institute of Molecular Biomedicine, </br>
and the Queensland University of Technology. The Malaghan Institute has research focuses </br>
from cancer, asthma and gut health, all of which can be benefit from nanopore sequencing. </br>
