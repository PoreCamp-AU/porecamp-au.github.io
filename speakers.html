<h2 id="jq">Joshua Quick (UK)</h2>

<h3 id="jq_bio">Biography</h3>

After undergraduate study Joshua worked for Illumina Technologies as intergration scientist. Before </br>
commencing his his PhD at the University of Birmingham, UK. </br>
Joshua is a founder of PoreCamp along with his supervisor Nick Loman. </br>
Throughout his PhD, Joshua has been able to show many successful </br>
applications of real-time nanopore sequencing as demonstrated in the publications below. </br>

<h3 id="de_ab">Abstract</h3>

<i> After the stampede of sequenced reads, when the QC dust has settled and the mapping has been done, </br>
    it's time to explore the jungle of data provided by the MinION. You will be guided through the process of </br>
    pulling out signal from the noise, using MinION reads for variant detection and error correction, and shown </br>
    how these discoveries can be presented in a way that is easy to understand.</i> </br>

<h3 id="de_bio">Biography</h3>

David Eccles is a freelance bioinformatician who has worked (mostly remotely) for a number of different researchers  </br>
around the world. He is currently working out of an office at the <a href="http://www.malaghan.org.nz/news/miniature-dna-sequencer-on-trial/">Malaghan  </br>
Institute of Medical Research</a>, where he has been learning about immunology, flow cytometry,   </br>
and the all the things that can go wrong with the MinION sequencing device.  </br>  </br>

David's first placement as a conference speaker was talking about MinION sequencing at the 2015 NGS conference  </br>
in New Zealand, which led to a <a  href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgZVVHJMlw">TEDxWellington </br>
talk</a> in March 2016 where he did sequencing on stage from a tomato source. </br>

<h2 id="mdc">Minh Duc Cao (NZ)</h2>

<h3 id="mdc_bio">Biography</h3>

Dr Minh Duc Cao is a senior research officer at Institute for Molecular Bioscience at The University of Queensland. </br>
He completed his PhD in Bioinformatics at Monash University where he applied statistics and information theory </br>
into modelling genomics data. His current research lies in using high‐throughput sequencing data to investigate </br>
genomic variation. Since the introduction of nanopore sequencing technology, he has been developing streamline </br>
algorithms for analysing its data, which take the advantage of ``sequencing in real‐time" while being able to </br>
handle the high error rates of the data. </br>
